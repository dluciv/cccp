# CCCP

Applications and automation scripts often use `xclip`, `xsel`, `wl-clipboard`, `pbcopy` and different alternatives to access clipboard.
CCCP aims to be united frontend for them, allowing to free other users and developers from selecting or detecting them.

This tool was initially created for personal use. But you are welcome to contribute, report issues, suggest features, etc.
I have almost no time to maintain and develop it beyound my personal needs, so the most welcome requests are those coming with pull requests =).

## Usage

* `cccp c` reads `STDIN` and copies it to the clipboard.
* `cccp p` pastes from the clipboard to `STDOUT`.
* `cccp ac ... ... ...` (Arg Copy) copies `... ... ...` to the clipboard.
* `cccp cf ...` (Copy File) copies `...` file contents to the clipboard.

## Installation & Configuration

### Installation

`cccp` can be easily symlinked to any location you already have in your `$PATH`, e.g. `~/.local/bin` (this is how I use it).

CCCP is not a standalone tool. For the most platforms, it also depends on tools, which are not always installed by default:

* Linux ‚Äî `xclip` and/or `wl-clipboard`, depending on your environment.
* Android with Termux ‚Äî [`termux-api` package](https://github.com/termux/termux-api-package) + [Termux:API](https://github.com/termux/termux-api)
* Windows ‚Äî any Bash (Cygwin, MSYS, etc.) with `dos2unix` and PowerShell (now it is usually available out of the box).
* Any Unix-like OS accessed remotely via SSH or Telnet ‚Äì Python 3+ to interact with local clipboard via OSC 52 terminal sequences.

### Configuration

With zero configuration it tries to autodetect the backend. However you can either override or help it (to run faster) by placing simple configuration file like

```
BACKEND=wayland
```

named `~/.config/cccp.conf` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cccp.conf` if you have `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`).

#### Hacker notes üßî

* You can temporarily override backend via environment as follows: `CCCP_BACKEND=whatever cccp ...`.
* `cccp.conf` is just a shell script, so you can place some logic here, e.g. switchng between XOrg and Wayland in Linux (see `cccp` script itself), etc.
* Fan of oldschool editors?
  * Like Midnight Commander and its built-in editor as I do? Find `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mc/ini` and edit two settings manually: set `clipboard_store=cccp cf` and 
`clipboard_paste=cccp p`. Make sure MC will not owerwrite it (e.g. quit all MCs and use another editor =)).
  * Like Vi(m) as I do too? =) Then `vnoremap <C-F11> y:call system('cccp c', @")<CR>` or use any other shortcut and register you want.
    * *This does not work on remotes with OSC 52 (see below) likely because vim filters command output aggressively. Then use `vnoremap <C-F10> ::w !cccp c<CR><CR>` ‚Äî it appears to work, but always copies the whole lines with selection. You can also try to give up on cccp and use [this plugin](https://github.com/fcpg/vim-osc52), but it did not copy in my case.*
  * Like something other only using a clipfile? Then take a look at [`watch_clipfile_to_cccp`](utilities/watch_clipfile_to_cccp).

#### OSC 52

Probably the most sane way to deal with clipboard on *remote* hosts is to bridge *local* (where the human is) clipboard to remote apps.
And it is possible.

*TL;DR:* If your local and remote software works fine with it and you need a setting for your headless server, I recommend `BACKEND=osc52c` (not `osc52`!)

**Security Note**

*Clipboard sharing is, for example, supported by XWindows apps bridged through SSH for many years.
Console apps can also access clipboard if your terminal supports and accepts
[OSC 52 control sequences](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h3-Operating-System-Commands).
[Many terminals do](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/k1ydpn/a_guide_on_how_to_copy_text_from_anywhere/).
XWindows apps are now rarely bridged via SSH, but SSHing to the remote shell is quite common.
And that's why clipboard sharing can not be considered 100% safe: imagine yourself using SSH to log into some server with
a sort of hacked shell or other malware running.
If your terminal accepts OSC 52, then this remote malware can insensibly read your local clipboard.
In my opinion the most proper way to handle it is asking user, for example once per session, if (s)he wants to enable OSC 52.
So using CCCP or not, use your terminal with care =).*

OSC 52 is supported in CCCP with two helper scripts in Python 3 (thus requiring Python 3 to be installed).

Also tune your local terminal, considering security note above. For example, my favorite [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) can be either tuned via `kitty.conf` for:

* Just copying from remote hosts: `clipboard_control write-primary write-clipboard no-append`.
* Copying from and pasting to remote hosts: `clipboard_control write-primary write-clipboard no-append read-primary read-clipboard`.
* The safer options (instead of above last two) `... read-primary-ask read-clipboard-ask` introduced in kitty [0.24.0](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/releases/tag/v0.24.0) to [ask user about paste](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/4022).

To activate OSC 52, tune CCCP, as described above, setting `BACKEND=osc52c` (recommended) or `BACKEND=osc52`. Because of above security issue, this backend is not autodetected.

* `osc52` will try to copy and paste as usual.
* `osc52c` will only copy and set non-zero exit status when trying to paste. Use your terminal pasting feature manually.
  This option is safe but, only half-functional, thus also not autodetected. Nevertheless this is my personal favorite option for headless servers =).

## Name

CCCP ‚Äì Common Clipboard Copy &amp; Paste. Those who know Russian may also read it as [¬´–°–°–°–†¬ª, which is 'USSR' in Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) ‚ò≠üêª =).

The reason behind the name was to find some short abbrevation, which is still free. There is another tool ‚Äî¬†The GNU C-Compatible Compiler Preprocessor ‚Äî which [theoretically can be invoked as `cccp` on Solaris](https://www.opennet.ru/man.shtml?topic=cccp&category=1), but in the wild life I only met C preprocessor invoked as `cpp`.

## Related Work

No doubt this tool is not the first one in its family.
For example [this one](https://github.com/sindresorhus/clipboard-cli) can be found easily.
Comparing to it, the idea behind CCCP was to keep it as lightweight as possible.
